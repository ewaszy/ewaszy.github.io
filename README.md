Plotly and Belly Button Biodiversity

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, and upload the dashboard to a cloud server. The dashboard was created based on a dataset containing information about test subjects and bacteria found within thier bellbuttons. 

* Created bar, line, and pie charts with Plotly
* Used D3.json() to fetch external data from CSV files and Web API's. 
* Parsed data in JSON format
* Manipulated data with functional programming in JavaScript
* Manipulated numbers using JavaScript's Math Library 
* Added interactive elements to the data visualizations using event handlers in JavaScript

# Summary 

Initial Project: 

A partially completed dashboard containing a panel for demographic information for each test subject was created. 

Challenge:

Completed the dashboard to include three different types of interactive visualizations for the dataset. Each visualization updates to display the correct data when a new subject is selected from th dropdown menu. 

This was accomplished in 4 deliverables:

1. A horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species in descending order
2. A bubble chart that displays the number of the top 10 bacterial species in proportion to the size of the marks
3. A gague that indicates how many times a subject washed thier bellybutton per week 
4. Dashboard customizations: Modified the color scheme, added image to jumbotron, rearranged layout of dashbaord.

Additional suggested customizations for further practice: 
* Use a custom font with contrast for the colors
* Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page
* Add information about what each graph visualizes, either under or next to each graph
* Make the webpage mobile-responsive
* Add a navigation bar that allows you to select the bar or bubble chart
